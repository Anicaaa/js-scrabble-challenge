// PSEUDO CODE
// 1. You want an object and arrays inside it with all the given letters/alphabets with their own scores.
// 2. A class, constructor and this.word
// 3. You want 2 or 3 paragraphs about if not a string (!= this.word), (this.word = ('\t) || this.word = ('/n)). For all of these 3 return 0.
// 4. A loop that generates all the letters/alphabets
// 5. return a number based on what happened inside the loop. So return += score.
